# React-Three-Fiber-Boilerplate (Webpack Version)

The Create React App / React Scripts / CRA is no longer maintained.

If using them, when running `npm install`, you will get a warning indicating many vulnerabilities.

It is debatable whether this is a real issue or not since you are only developing locally.

However, this `webpack` branch is set up similar to how `react-scripts` does it.

- It serves the dev version on port 3000
- It auto opens the browser at address http://localhost:3000
- It enables Hot Module Reloading (HMR)
- It serves the development version from the ./public folder
- `npm run build` builds a production quality version of your app, and will copy all static files & folders under `./public` to the `./build` folder ready for deployment
- Production `bundle.js` contains a hash in its name to prevent caching
- It indicates 0 vulnerabilities when running `npm install`, at time of writing this message

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/Sean-Bradley/React-Three-Fiber-Boilerplate.git
cd React-Three-Fiber-Boilerplate
git checkout webpack
npm install
npm start
```

Your default browser should open http://localhost:3000/ automatically for you.

You should see a green wireframe cube.
